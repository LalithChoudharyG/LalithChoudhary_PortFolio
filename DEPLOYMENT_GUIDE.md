# Deployment Guide for Vercel

## Steps to Deploy Your React Project on Vercel

1. **Sign Up / Log In to Vercel**
   - Go to [Vercel's website](https://vercel.com).
   - Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account.

2. **Install Vercel CLI (Optional)**
   - You can deploy directly from the Vercel dashboard, but if you prefer using the command line, install the Vercel CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g vercel
     ```

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the root of your project:
     ```bash
     cd c:/Users/lalit/Desktop/LSPORTFOLIO
     ```

4. **Deploy Your Project**
   - If using the Vercel CLI, run the following command:
     ```bash
     vercel
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to configure your deployment. You may need to specify the project name and link it to your Vercel account.

5. **Configure Build Settings (if needed)**
   - If prompted, ensure that the build command is set to `npm run build` and the output directory is set to `build`.

6. **Visit Your Deployed Site**
   - Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL to access your deployed site.

7. **Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - If you have a custom domain, you can set it up in the Vercel dashboard under the "Domains" section.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your project is working correctly locally before deploying.
- Check the Vercel documentation for more advanced configurations and settings.
